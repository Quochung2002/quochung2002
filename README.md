### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Hung Tran and I'm a Ph.D student at Virginia Tech. I'm passionate about contextual optimization and stochastic research in quantitative finance and econophysics. 

Research fields of interest: 
* Genetic Algorithms (GAs) optimization & Quantum Finance SchrÃ¶dinger Equation (QFSE).
* Feynmanâ€™s Path Integral models in Asset Pricing. 
* LÃ©vy flight & Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

Teaching Experience:
* Theory of organization
* Advanced math modeling in prescriptive analytics
* Operations research & business analytics

Key Technical Skills: 
* Programming languages: Python | Java | C/C++ | SQL | R | AMPL | CPLEX | STATA
* Establishing financial models relating to portfolio optimization and investment plans
* Constructing interactive visualizations using VizQL on Tableau visualization packages


I'm looking to learn more from the GitHub community about the field of operation research and financial engineering using advanced mathematical methods and application of Computer Programming.
